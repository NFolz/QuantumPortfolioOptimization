This is an iteration of a quantum portfolio optimization algorithm. This algorithm, based on the Markowitz portfolio theory, receives a list of stock data from an API, formulates our unique objective function, and submits it to D-Wave's Quantum Processing Unit for computation. 




How to get started with the dwave quantum processing use

1. pip install dwave-ocean-sdk
2. dwave auth login 
// You can now use "dwave auth get" to fetch your token.
